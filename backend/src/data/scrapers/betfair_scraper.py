Betfair Exchange Odds Scraper
==============================

Scrapes exchange odds from Betfair for sharp line comparison.

Features:
- Back/lay odds for home/draw/away
- Matched liquidity information
- Exchange vs bookmaker edge calculation
- Historical odds movement tracking

Exchange odds are typically sharper than bookmaker odds and provide
additional signal for value bet detection.
