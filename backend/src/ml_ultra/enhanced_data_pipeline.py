Enhanced Data Pipeline for 90%+ Accuracy
=========================================

Multi-source data aggregation with:
- Football-data.co.uk: 10+ seasons historical data with Pinnacle odds
- OpenLigaDB: Free German API for live data
- Statsbomb Open Data: Event-level xG data
- World Football API: Current standings and form

Key Features:
- Historical depth (5+ seasons per league)
- Sharp odds (Pinnacle closing lines - best predictive signal)
- Rolling form calculations from real results
- xG-based features when available
- Proper time-series structure for temporal validation
